/**
 * Place the first picture in a paragraph, converting its container as needed.
 *
 * - Asking for a `vertical` position (or `float: true`) FLOATS an inline
 *   picture: `wp:inline` → `wp:anchor` with both axes written as named
 *   alignments relative to `relativeTo` (default `page`). This is the only way
 *   "centre it on the page" can be expressed in OOXML.
 * - `float: false` returns a floating picture to the text flow — the positioning
 *   children are dropped and the container becomes `wp:inline` again.
 * - Passing ONLY `horizontal` on an inline picture changes nothing here: it is
 *   the carrier PARAGRAPH's `w:jc` that moves an in-flow picture sideways, and
 *   floating a picture just to nudge it left would change how text flows around
 *   it. The caller handles that case (`changed: false` with `floating: false`
 *   is the signal). On an already-floating picture, `horizontal` IS applied.
 *
 * Everything outside the container's geometry prefix — the whole `a:graphic`
 * subtree, so the image itself, its crop, its effects — is copied byte for byte.
 *
 * ON `mc:AlternateContent`. A great many real pictures ship as a pair: an
 * `mc:Choice` holding the modern DrawingML, and an `mc:Fallback` holding a VML
 * twin of the same picture for readers older than Word 2007. This function used
 * to refuse the whole paragraph on sight of one, on the theory that rewriting a
 * single branch leaves the file inconsistent. That was the wrong trade, and a
 * student's بسم الله page proved it within the hour: the tool refused, the
 * assistant reported the capability as missing, and the student got nothing —
 * over a compatibility branch that no Word since 2007 has read.
 *
 * So: the `mc:Choice` drawing IS the picture, and it is repositioned. The
 * `mc:Fallback` twin is left exactly as it was — Word never renders it, our own
 * reader already discards it (`stripAltContentFallback`), and rewriting VML
 * geometry is a second, unrelated language. `legacyTwin` reports that it is
 * there. Only a drawing found INSIDE the fallback is refused, because moving the
 * copy nobody renders would look, to the student, like nothing happened.
 *

 * this function is to hit ONE paragraph, which a shared style cannot do.

 * Clear the "data descriptor present" flag on entries that do not have one.
 *
 * LibreOffice (and anything else that streams a zip) sets general-purpose bit 3
 * and appends a descriptor after each entry. adm-zip re-writes such an archive
 * with real sizes and CRCs in the headers but WITHOUT the descriptor — while
 * faithfully copying the flag that promises one. The result is a perfectly valid
 * zip by every other reader (`unzip -t` passes, Word opens it) that adm-zip's own
 * reader then refuses with "No descriptor present".
 *
 * That matters here because the server re-opens its own output on the next edit:
 * one save of a LibreOffice-authored upload was enough to make every later AI
 * edit of that thesis fail to load. Clearing the lying flag is a two-byte fix per
 * entry, and it makes the bytes describe what is actually in the file.
 *
 * Bails out untouched on anything unexpected (Zip64, truncated directory, a
 * local header that doesn't line up) — a half-rewritten zip is far worse than an
 * unhelpful one.

/**
 * Picture PLACEMENT surgery: where a `<w:drawing>` sits on the page.
 *
 * Word stores a picture in one of two containers, and which one it is decides
 * everything about where it can go:
 *
 *  - `<wp:inline>` — the picture IS a character in the text flow. It can only be
 *    where the line is; "put it in the middle of the page" is not expressible.
 *  - `<wp:anchor>` — the picture FLOATS, with a `wp:positionH`/`wp:positionV`
 *    pair naming a frame of reference (`page`, `margin`, …) and either an offset
 *    or a named alignment. This is Word's Layout ▸ Position dialog, and
 *    "Position in Middle Center relative to Page" is exactly
 *    `<wp:align>center</wp:align>` on both axes relative to `page`.
 *
 * So vertical placement is not a property you can set on a picture — it is a
 * container conversion. That is what {@link applyDrawingLayout} does, in both
 * directions, copying every other byte of the drawing through untouched (the
 * `a:graphic` subtree, which holds the image reference, is never even read).
 *
 * TWO RULES the schema enforces, both of which would produce a file Word refuses
 * to open if broken:
 *
 *  1. `CT_Anchor` is an ORDERED sequence — simplePos, positionH, positionV,
 *     extent, effectExtent?, <wrap>, docPr, cNvGraphicFramePr?, graphic. The
 *     wrap element in particular goes immediately BEFORE `wp:docPr`, not at the
 *     end where appending would put it.
 *  2. Geometry is read and written on the PREFIX before `<a:graphic` only. A
 *     shape's text box can contain a whole nested drawing, so a free search for
 *     `wp:positionV` can find a child's and move the wrong picture.

 * docx-doctor — inspect a .docx package for the corruption classes that actually
 * bite this product, and mechanically repair the ones that can be repaired.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * An AI edit writes real OOXML into a real student's thesis. When it writes the
 * wrong SHAPE, Word does not warn and does not repair — it refuses the file
 * outright ("Word experienced an error trying to open the file"), and the damage
 * is already on disk. Every defect below is one we have shipped at least once:
 *
 *  • **Schema sequence.** `w:tblPr`, `w:tcPr`, `w:pPr`, `w:sectPr` and `w:style`
 *    are `xsd:sequence` — child ORDER is a hard constraint, and `bidiVisual`
 *    after `tblW` killed an Arabic thesis. Well-formed ≠ valid, so `xmllint` sees
 *    nothing. (`w:rPr` and `w:trPr` are deliberately NOT checked: their schema
 *    types are repeated CHOICES, so their child order is free.)
 *  • **Story shape.** A story must not end with a table, and two adjacent tables
 *    merge into one. Word writes an empty `<w:p/>` at both spots; hand-built
 *    OOXML forgets to.
 *  • **Body order.** Any manager that round-trips `word/document.xml` through
 *    xml2js regroups `<w:body>` children BY TAG, hoisting every table above every
 *    paragraph. Block indices here are positional (op queue, RAG chunks, edits),
 *    so that silently rewires the whole document. Unfixable in place — the order
 *    is genuinely gone — so we detect it loudly and point at history restore.
 *  • **Dropped spaces.** The same xml2js path runs `trim:true`, which turns
 *    Word's inter-word space runs (`<w:t xml:space="preserve"> </w:t>`) into
 *    `<w:t/>`. Words glue together. We can't recover an emptied run, but we CAN
 *    stop the next save from dropping the spaces still present.
 *  • **Package integrity.** Dangling relationship targets, missing
 *    `[Content_Types].xml` overrides, duplicate rIds — each on its own makes Word
 *    refuse the document.
 *  • **Lying zip flags.** adm-zip re-writes a streamed archive keeping the
 *    "a data descriptor follows" flag it did not honour, and then cannot read its
 *    own output back. See `clearFalseDataDescriptors`.
 *
 * ## Shape of the module
 *
 * Pure functions over a duck-typed zip, exactly like `hf-part-repair.ts` (which
 * stays as the chrome-op fast path; both only ever move a part toward the same
 * canonical shape, so running either or both is idempotent). String surgery on
 * purpose: a parse/rebuild round-trip is the very thing that causes half the
 * defects listed above.
 *
 * `inspectDocx(zip)` reports. `inspectDocx(zip, { fix: true })` also repairs, in
 * place, and lists the parts it rewrote. `checkDocxBuffer` / `repairDocxBuffer`
 * are the byte-level wrappers; the repairing one re-opens its own output and
 * discards the whole repair unless every rewritten part still parses and no new
 * fatal appeared. Verified against real theses: four Word-authored student
 * documents come back completely clean and untouched, and a repair never changes
 * a single `<w:t>` payload — it only ever moves markup.
