/**
 * Paragraph-level OOXML surgery: the `<w:pPr>` counterpart to `runProps.ts`.
 *
 * Two capabilities live here, both of which act on ONE paragraph's XML and
 * leave every other byte of it untouched:
 *
 *  - PAGINATION (`w:keepNext`, `w:keepLines`, `w:widowControl`,
 *    `w:pageBreakBefore`) — Word's "keep with next" / "keep lines together" /
 *    "widow and orphan control" / "page break before" paragraph properties.
 *    These are the ones that stop a heading being stranded alone at the foot of
 *    a page, which no tool could express before.
 *
 *  - DIRECT RUN FORMATTING for a SINGLE paragraph ({@link applyRunPropsToParagraph}).
 *    `TextStyleManager` styles named PARTS of a document through their Word
 *    style; this styles one paragraph and nothing else, which is what "make THIS
 *    heading 48pt" means — restyling Heading1 would resize every chapter title.
 *
 * Everything routes through {@link updateParagraphProps}, which re-canonicalises
 * `<w:pPr>` into `CT_PPr` order on the way out. That is not a nicety: `w:keepNext`
 * belongs directly after `w:pStyle`, near the FRONT of the sequence, while an
 * Arabic thesis paragraph already carries `w:bidi` and `w:jc` from much later in
 * it. Appending would emit a sequence violation and Word would refuse the file.
